title: "Up in the air: The vague Byju’s-NITI Aayog stab at public edtech"
subtitle: 
author: Arpit Arora, Olina Banerji
excerpt: "Byju’s big bang entry into the public sector comes via a headline-making partnership with NITI Aayog that promises free educational resources. But without inputs from on-ground stakeholders, the programme is seeing a serious mismatch between Byju’s content offerings and the realities of a post-pandemic learning gap."

## Summary

- The $20 billion edtech giant Byju’s has set its sight on the public education system in India. It has a willing partner in NITI Aayog

- Byju’s wants to target students in India’s most developmentally challenged states; its products aren’t a great fit for the audience

- Unwilling to customise its offering, Byju’s wants to stay away from complex on-ground operations

- This has already led to confusion with state-level functionaries, who are waiting for Byju’s to make the first move
