subtitle: 
author: Arpit Arora
excerpt: "LEAD wants to be the go-to brand for thousands of India’s private schools—where students pay Rs 1,000 or less as monthly fees—to go digital. In two years, it wants to double the number of schools it’s present in, but to get there, it has to tighten more than a few product screws."

## Summary

- In the last two years, LEAD has expanded from 600 partner schools to nearly 5,000; it raised $100 million recently, becoming a unicorn in the process

- Teachers are the centre of its plans to digitise classrooms—by removing the management and lesson planning headache, LEAD lets them focus on teaching

- LEAD’s solutions work well for splashy marketing, but they’re difficult to tailor for a diverse range of students. They’re also expensive

- The only way LEAD can make bank is by scaling; it has enough runway to hit 10,000 schools but organic growth will not come easy
