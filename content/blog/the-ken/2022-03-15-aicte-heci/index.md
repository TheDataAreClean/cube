title: "AICTE to HECI: Alphabet soup for India’s autonomy-starved technical institutions"
subtitle: 
author: Arpit Arora
excerpt: "As India’s apex body on technical education, AICTE was expected to promote the quality of technical education, but tight control and excessive red tape has stunted its growth. The government is working on a draft bill for a new regulatory body, but for technical institutions, it’ll just mean one invigilator in place of another."

## Summary

- Established in 1945 to improve the quality of technical education in India, AICTE’s authority has expanded, often at the expense of the autonomy of engineering colleges

- AICTE’s reach is so thorough that engineering colleges have been restricted in much of their operations from curriculum design to interdisciplinary research

- With the skills and unemployment challenges looming large, the clock is running out on India’s engineering education crisis

- The government is working on revamping the draft HECI Bill, which got its fair share of brickbats, but it may not be enough to stem the tide
