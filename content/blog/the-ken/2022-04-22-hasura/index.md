subtitle: 
author: Arpit Arora
excerpt: "India’s first open source unicorn, Hasura has shattered the notion that proprietary solutions are the sole path to building a billion-dollar business.

- Hasura has built a strong community of contributors that fix bugs, build new features, and even help improve the documentation

- But to succeed as an open source business, Hasura will have to serve as both an educator and a champion of the model
