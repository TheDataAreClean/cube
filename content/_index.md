I am a statistician by trade, who has helped coo-create numerous data centeric digital solutions over the last 6 years. Currently, I am working at [CivicDataLab](https://civicdatalab.inl) on the intersection of education and public finance using novel datasets to better understand the state of education in rural India and Scotland.\n\n

I believe in building sustainable and intersectional solutions for the society, which understand the potential and potential harms of using data to solve societal challenges. In my personal life I am extremely private person and don't like to share my identity, specially my face. I am an avid cyclist, devourer of books, passionate about `#RStats`!"
