I am a cross functional researcher who loves to try on new lenses in approaching a problem statement. My experiences range from data analytics to product development to journalism, and now monitoring and evaluation programmes all set in the social development context. 

The core of my work lies in improving the data literacy of new audiences through a variety of mediums, and increasing their decision making capacity.
