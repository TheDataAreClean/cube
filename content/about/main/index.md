  I have been working on research studies and monitoring and evaluation programmes focusing on nano-entrepreneurship in India. I am also experimenting with new visual mediums to make fundamental statistical concepts accessible to a wider audience.

  ## Why `cube` ?
  
  I am a fairly private person who doesn't like sharing their name and photo online, and through the years `cube` has becime my default identity, even amongst friends. It’s not like you won’t find me on the internet if you look around, it's probably somewhere on this website too! But why offer it myself?
  
  ## Why `TheDataAreClean` ?
  
  The name was partly inspired by my experiences of working with data all these years and understanding the importance of cleaning the data, and partly by a PHD Comics [strip](https://twitter.com/phdcomics/status/858434932695195648) which wonders if data is singular or plural. I hope you enjoy the wordplay as much as I do!
