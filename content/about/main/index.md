  ## Why `cube` ?
  
  I am a fairly private person and prefer not to share my name or photo online. Through the years, `cube` has become my default identity amongst friends and colleagues. And it’s not like you won’t find me online if you look around, but why offer it myself?
  
  ## Why `TheDataAreClean` ?
  
  The name was partly inspired by my experiences of working with data all these years and understanding the importance of cleaning the data, and partly by a PHD Comics [strip](https://twitter.com/phdcomics/status/858434932695195648) which wonders if data is singular or plural. I hope you enjoy the wordplay as much as I do!
