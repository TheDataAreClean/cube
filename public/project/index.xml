      <description>Background      The Northern Alliance of Scotland is a regional improvement collaborative, spanning across and supporting eight local authorities and their associated school settings to improve education and reduce the poverty related attainment gap. Within these settings, children, young people and their families live across a diverse range of urban and rural settlements.
The aim of this collaboration is to determine what data sources and analytical techniques best reflect the challenges of child poverty, and subsequently provide a means to assess the poverty related attainment gap as a result â€“ which will further allow individual school settings, local authorities and other bodies to plan targeted interventions to reduce it.</description>
