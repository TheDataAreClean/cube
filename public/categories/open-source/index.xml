      <description>Background     Ironing nano-entrepreneurs (vyapaaris) in India are stationed at every neighbourhood, collecting clothes from the local residents and ironing them. These vyapaaris primarily work with Coal iron boxes, where coal is the input fuel that heats the boxes. This product has not evolved in decades. The current product and market conditions make it difficult for vyapaaris to sustain and grow their businesses.
Every morning vyapaaris spend nearly 2 hours to heat up coal, taking up time to iron more clothes or earn additional income.</description>
